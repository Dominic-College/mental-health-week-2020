			<div><h2>Mental health week at Dominic College</h2>
				<p>Mental Health Week in Tasmania this year will be from the 5th - 10th of october. We at Dominic will be celebrating it the week before from the 24th - 28th August 2020. The theme will be <i>'We all have a role to play.' </i> Given all that has already happened in 2020 we think the theme this year couldn't be more appropriate. We all have a role to play to find ways to support our own mental health and the mental health of our families and friends. During the COVID-19 crisis we have had to develop new and innovative ways of keeping connected, checking in with each other and preventing ill-health where possible. It's time to start looking forward to fun and engaging events and activities for MHW at Dominic College.</p>
				<p>There will be many fun activities happening for MHW. Most of these events will happen at lunchtimes with a few happening at recess, in classes and afterschool. There will also be Hot Milo and Muffin for breakfast one or more of the mornings. The timetable down below will tell you more about whats happening this week. Hope you have fun and take part in these fun activities.</p>
