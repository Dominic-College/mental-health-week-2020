			<div><h2>Mental health week at Dominic College</h2>
				<p>Mental Health Week in Tasmania this year will be from the 5th - 10th of october. We at Dominic will be celebrating it the week before from the 24th - 28th August 2020. The theme will be <i>'We all have a role to play.' </i> Given all that has already happened in 2020 we think the theme this year couldn't be more appropriate. We all have a role to play to find ways to support our own mental health and the mental health of our families and friends. During the COVID-19 crisis we have had to develop new and innovative ways of keeping connected, checking in with each other and preventing ill-health where possible. It's time to start looking forward to fun and engaging events and activities for MHW at Dominic College.</p>
				<p>There will be many fun activities happening for MHW. Most of these events will happen at lunchtimes with a few happening at recess, in classes and afterschool. There will also be Hot Milo and Muffin for breakfast one or more of the mornings. The timetable down below will tell you more about whats happening this week. Hope you have fun and take part in these fun activities.</p>

				<h2>Academic Goals</h2>
				<p>Academic goals will be the area where most students should focus their goals. In this area students can identify areas they wish to change or improve in their learning and how to manage their life so they can optimize their learning.</p>
				<p>Academic goals will emerge from students considering their strengths and areas of development. The most recent academic progress report can provide the basis for student and teacher reflection. Goals associated with diligence, work standards and completion and quality of work are the kinds of goals students might identify. Time management, schoolwork and life balance may often be an area for student goal setting.</p>
				<p>Students can be encouraged to further extend themselves in areas of strength and teachers can support them to consider goals that further enrich and challenge themselves.</p>
				<p>In identifying areas of improvement, areas such as attendance, punctuality, organisation, personal appearance and support of the College values and rules will be areas that some students should be encouraged to set goals.</p>
