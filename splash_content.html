				<h2>Rational</h2>
				<p>The effectiveness of an education program for each student can be improved when appropriate goals are set in place by students with their teachers, and if possible, parents. There are a multitude of benefits that exist for students when specific learning goals are set. </p>
				<p>When students learn and practise how to set and achieve goals, especially with their school work, they learn how to take more ownership of their education. They learn how they play a significant role in their own education and in their future. </p>

				<p>Successful people have one quality in common and that is the habit of goal setting. If students are taught to set goals during their schooling, they will learn to set goals, pertaining to their career and personal life. Goal setting for students aims to inculcate self-esteem, discipline, focus, concentration, dedication and hard work.</p>
				<p>The purpose of establishing a goal setting framework and process at Dominic College, is to establish an explicit way to help students succeed in school and in life. The process links into the Empower Program where students learn: to identify and overcome potential roadblocks; to stay focused and positive; the importance of learning from their mistakes; and learn how to breakdown big projects into small doable parts.</p>
				<p>The objectives of the Dominic College Goal Setting Process are to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Help students take responsibility for their academic and personal development;</li>
					<li>Enable students to set priorities in the areas they wish to achieve or improve;</li>
					<li>Assist students to plan to achieve their aims; </li>
					<li>Help students to identify potential roadblocks they may encounter in reaching their goals and how to overcome them; and</li>
					<li>Support students to have determination and learn how to act on their dreams.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Academic Goals</h2>
				<p>Academic goals will be the area where most students should focus their goals. In this area students can identify areas they wish to change or improve in their learning and how to manage their life so they can optimize their learning.</p>
				<p>Academic goals will emerge from students considering their strengths and areas of development. The most recent academic progress report can provide the basis for student and teacher reflection. Goals associated with diligence, work standards and completion and quality of work are the kinds of goals students might identify. Time management, schoolwork and life balance may often be an area for student goal setting.</p>
				<p>Students can be encouraged to further extend themselves in areas of strength and teachers can support them to consider goals that further enrich and challenge themselves.</p>
				<p>In identifying areas of improvement, areas such as attendance, punctuality, organisation, personal appearance and support of the College values and rules will be areas that some students should be encouraged to set goals.</p>
