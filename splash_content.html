				<h2>Mental health week at Dominic College</h2>
				<p>Mental Health Week in Tasmania this year will be from the 5th - 10th of October. At Dominic will be celebrating Mental Health Week from the 24th - 28th August 2020. The theme will be <i>'We all have a role to play.' </i> Given all that has already happened in 2020 we think the theme this year couldn't be more appropriate. We all have a role to play to find ways to support our own mental health and the mental health of our families and friends. During the COVID-19 crisis we have had to develop new and innovative ways of keeping connected, checking in with each other and preventing ill-health where possible. It's time to start looking forward to fun and engaging events and activities for MHW at Dominic College.</p>
				<p>There will be many fun activities happening for MHW. Most of these events will happen at lunchtimes with a few happening at recess, in classes and afterschool. There will also be Hot Milo and Muffin/Fruit for breakfast some mornings. The links to the timetable will tell you more about what's happening this week. Hope you have fun and take part in these fun activities.</p>
