				<h2 class="k6-h2">Lunchtime dance party:</h2>
				<p>Either Alli or Olivia will have music playing for students to dance, dance, dance to.</p>

				<h2 class="k6-h2"> Positive Chalk Pathways:</h2>
				<p>We have ordered a large number of containers of chalk and will bring them to grade classrooms. You may have a small group of students who may like to look up a positive quote to draw on the pathway outside your classroom. We will also have chalk out at lunchtime and recess on the oval and K-2 area.</p>

				<h2 class="k6-h2"> Bright Colours Day for Isla:</h2>
				<p>This is a CLT endorsed fundraiser for the Kapeller family. We are encouraging everyone to wear bright, fun colours – the brighter the better! There is a newsletter article and correspondence being written for parent information. We ask all students to bring a $2 donation for the family, though some may like to bring more. We will also be selling Icy Poles at lunchtime as part of this fundraiser.</p>

				<h2 class="k6-h2"> Morning Milo and a piece of fruit:</h2>
				<p>Like last year we are making milo in MMK on Wednesday and Friday morning. We cannot have students bring a cup due to covid restrictions. This will run from 8.30 – 9.00. Any staff who are able to help us with this on these mornings, the support would be VERY much appreciated. </p>
